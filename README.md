# Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and the first video game with endless gameplay (meaning there was no      final level or endscreen) and set the template for the genre. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser cannon to earn as many points as possible. 

# Gameplay 
# This version of Space Invaders only includes three levels with each level increasing slightly in movment and fire rate of aliens
